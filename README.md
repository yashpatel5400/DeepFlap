# DeepFlap
Keras deep learning implementation of beating Flappy bird. Please feel free to follow along with 
my videos where you get to see the process of developing this projects and can develop on your
own as well! The tutorial is linked in both YouTube and Medium at my corresponding channels:

## Outline
The basic idea behind this project is to find an opportunity that uses reinforcement learning along
with basic concepts from computer vision. We'll be exploring this project using the following
libraries, all of which are used extensively in modern machine learning!
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- scikit-image
- opencv

The project consists of four main parts, which you'll be able to see through my discussion in the
video tutorials:
- Preprocessing (computer vision)
- Game input (interacting programmatically)
- Reinforcement learning (determining the best actions)
- Training (cleaning and testing)

Come check out the tutorials, and I would love to hear feedback from all of you!
